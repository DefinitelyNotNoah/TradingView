In under 50 lines of code, with inputs, plots, styling, and alerts included we're able to create trendlines with a breakout system.

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How it works
Calculating pivot points helps traders identify moments at which the market's attitude can shift from bullish to bearish (vice versa). In the background, the script tracks pivot events for trendlines and uses a system that prevents any leakage between the trendlines before they are drawn.
